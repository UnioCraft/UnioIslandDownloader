# UnioIslandDownloader
You can download your ASkyBlock islands with this plugin. It's made for UnioCraft server and uploaded for archive purposes.

## How It Works?
- It selects and copies the island's area, and then save it to a schematic and moves it to your downloads folder. (Don't forget to change folders from source code.)
- I recommend using FastAsyncWorldEdit otherwise it might lag your server.
